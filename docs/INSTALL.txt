IMPORTANT: phpwsTimeLog is a module for phpWebSite.  You have to
install phpWebSite >= 0.10.0 first, phpwsTimeLog will not work with
earlier versions of phpWebSite.  If you don't have phpWebSite installed,
first get the code here:

https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL.txt included
in the docs directory of that download.

Once this is done then you can start installing phpwsTimeLog:

1. Download the .tar.gz from a sourceforge mirror.  (There is also a .zip
   file for Windows users.)

2. Unpack the tarball with:
    tar -xvzf module-phpwstimelog-*.tar.gz

3. Move the new directory into your phpwebsite mod directory. For example,
   if your phpwebsite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run:

    mv phpwstimelog /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/phpwstimelog

4. Go to your phpWS website and install Time Log from Boost.

5. (optional) phpwsTimeLog has added entries into Menu Manager.  You can
   go into the Menu Manager control panel and select the Menu that you would
   like to add the phpwsTimeLog link to.  Once you are in the menu editing
   screen click on the "Add Module Default" button.  On the resulting page
   select the "Time Log" item from the drop-down box and add it.

   You are golden.  phpwsTimeLog is now installed.
